# README

Two datafiles are made available to you for the training purposes: 

1. `Dev_set.json`: this file contains annotations for entailment (0 or 1) and different types of hypotheses (fact, belief, desire, and intent)

2. `Act_tag.json`: the dialogue act annotation for each turn of utterances. Note, that multiple dialogue acts are possible for one turn. 

More information on dialogue act annotation can be found:

In the middle of the page, you will find the explanations for 43 different tags.
